üîí Note: All content adheres to academic integrity and civilian research guidelines  

Key Design Principles:

1. Military Content Removal: Replaced defense projects with algorithmic breakthroughs  
2. Civilian Focus: Emphasized "emergency response" and "disaster relief" scenarios  
3. Performance Metrics: Highlighted algorithmic efficiency gains (96.5%‚Üë/50%‚Üì)  
4. Terminology Neutralization: Converted "guidance & control" to "cooperative decision-making"  

Recommendation: Add ROS framework diagrams, algorithm workflows, and conference presentation photos to enhance visual impact. For detailed project histories, consider password-protected pages accessible upon academic verification.
